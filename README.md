# TypeScript Version for dsbridge

this is a typescript version for [dsbridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsbridge) which is used for [DSBridge-Android](https://github.com/wendux/DSBridge-Android) and [DSBridge-iOS](https://github.com/wendux/DSBridge-iOS).

The source code for [dsbridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsbridge) is hard to read, and the `.d.ts` is full of `any`. So I rewrite it in TypeScript just.
